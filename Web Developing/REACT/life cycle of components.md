There are 3 stages of life cycles of the components:
 1.Mounting - when the component is built on dom for the first time;
 
 2.Updating - when a rerender occurs based on a change of state in a component,
                                                                    OR
    a prop or more that is passed down to a component is updated;
    
 3.Unmounting - when the component gets "destroyed" and is no longer present in the real DOM, this could happen because a change in state that will no longer render a certain component; 

! Each component has it's own life cycle !
